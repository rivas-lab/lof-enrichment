# lof-enrichment

## Cloning and Set Up
Use `git clone --recursive https://github.com/rivas-lab/lof-enrichment.git` to
clone this repo and automatically pull in the submodules as well. If you use
the typical `git clone` and need to pull in the submodules, change into the
repo and run `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

After cloning, change into the repo and use `git lfs pull` in case some files 
tracked with LFS were not downloaded. If you have just installed git LFS for
the first time, you may need to run `git lfs install` from the command line
first.
